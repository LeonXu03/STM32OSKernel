## About STM32 Real-Time OS Kernel
Developed a custom **Real-Time Executive Operating System** for the STM32 Nucleo Board. 

Includes support for: 
- **multitasking scheduling policies**
- **efficient dynamic memory allocation**
- **priority based task pre-emption**
  
Developed using extensive knowledge from **ECE350: Real-Time Operating Systems**

## Requirements
- STM32 NUCLEO-F401RE board
- STM32CubeIDE is the recommended code editor

## Run
- Plug in STM32 Nucleo board
- Clone and open repository using STM32CubeIDE as the code editor
- Click green play button at the top of the editor
- Observe the following test case results:
  - Performance of different multitasking scheduling policies
  - Efficient dynamic memory allocation and deallocation via buddy system algorithm
  - Efficient heap memory usage
  - Priority based task pre-emption
